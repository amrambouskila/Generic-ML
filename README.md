# Generic-ML

This generic machine learning function, `learn(df, indep_vars, dep_var, regression: bool = True, plot: bool = True)`, performs a grid search on whatever classification or regression needs you may have. All you need to do is input the dataframe, the independent variable column names (X), dependent variable name (y), and specify whether you are building a classification or regression model and if you want data visualization.
